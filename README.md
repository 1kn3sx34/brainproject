# Brain Project [![Evolve](https://img.shields.io/badge/Part%20of%20Evolve%20community%20project-Evolve-lightgrey)](https://evolution-org.webflow.io/)

## A research project to code a brain-based superintelligence. 
Learn and understand human brains and replicate their structure efficiently using open resources & libs.

### Why?
To learn and explore
- tiny details of behaviors of our brains
- understand the logic 
- how it processes all the sensory data 
- contextual data collection and storage for training and prediction
- context prediction to perform specific motor skills.

### Contribute by 
- sharing your knowledge about human psychology 
- breaking them into modules that can be coded 
- join development of any algorithm you like or based on community research
- sharing open resources for the community to use.
