# Brain Reduplication Project
Part of Evolve community project. https://evolution-org.webflow.io/

## This is a research project and aims to learn and understand the functioning of the human brain.

### You can be a part of it by 

- First understanding what is it that we will be trying to achieve. Briefly, we are trying to recreate the human brain by taking into account it's hidden efficiencies which we can now code and use open-source/self-made AI algorithms to do so. I know it sounds a little vague, so, whenever you're free, just send me an email and we'll discuss that in a meeting. It is worth the effort.
- Next, by constantly observing your subconscious and journal your thoughts. This will help create a framework of what all is to be recreated. 
- Next, contributors with coding experience can help develop the algorithms by picking up and recreating the phenomenons mentioned in the community-journal.
